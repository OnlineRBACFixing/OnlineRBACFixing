## Incomplete Solvers

### Time complexity based on Firewall1 variant

90 online fixing instances of increasing size have been generated from _Firewall1_ by selecting more and more of its users (i.e., rows); each instance is associated with a single exception to incorporate and generates a Max-SAT encoding of growing size.

The following figure shows the minimum timeout needed (y axis) to obtain a feasible solution for these inputs as a function of their size (x axis) with [B=0.8](complexity/Results.txt).

### Quality of incomplete solutions

Experiment based on _SmallComp_ dataset to measure the ability of the incomplete solver adopted to satisfy the soft constraints. In particular, this is computed as the average weight of satisfied soft constraints over the total sum of weights for the 12 exceptions. 

Average percentage of satisfied soft clauses (y axis) as a function of the balance B (x_axis) in the _SmallComp_ dataset:

Results are also available in plain text in [rates.txt](qualityIncompleteMaintenance/rates.txt) which are based on the evalaution of the three configurations:
- complete solver [Results.txt](qualityIncompleteMaintenance/Results.txt)
- incomplete solver (timeout 2 sec) [Results.txt](qualityIncompleteMaintenance/2/Results.txt)
- incomplete solver (timeout 180 sec) [Results.txt](qualityIncompleteMaintenance//180/Results.txt)


# Experimental Results 

## Impact of Beta

By adopting CCEHC Max-SAT solver we asses experimentally the impact of balance B to **sim** (similarity) and **opt** (simplicity) for three dataset.

- [SmallComp](preferencesImpact/optsim/SmallCompSimplicity180.dat) 
- [Domino](preferencesImpact/optsim/DominoSimplicity180.dat)
- [University](preferencesImpact/optsim/UniversitySimplicity360.dat)

Average similarity and simplicity (y axis) as a function of the balance B (x axis) with 21 values of B sampled at regular intervals:

## Impact of timeout

Results collected in the following are obtained starting from _Domino_ to show the impact of the timeout with three different balance configurations:

- [B = 0.15](timeImpact/Semplicity_w0.15_paper.dat) 
- [B = 0.4](timeImpact/Semplicity_w0.4_paper.dat) 
- [B = 0.65](timeImpact/Semplicity_w0.65_paper.dat) 
- [B = 0.9](timeImpact/Semplicity_w0.9_paper.dat) 


Average similarity in Domino (y axis) as a function of the timeout (x axis, secs) at different balance points B.

## The order of exceptions with a variant of _Domino_ dataset

We picked a string of 5 exceptions to be incorporated.

|Input| Link|  	   
|:-:	           |:---:	|
|Permission-to-User | [UPA](dataset/permutations/UPA.txt)|
|User-to-role      |[UA](dataset/permutations/UA.txt)  |
|Permission-to-Role | [PA](dataset/permutations/PA.txt) |
|Exception List           | [excs](dataset/permutations/excs.txt)| 

We generated all the  120 permutations as possibly different incorporating sequences. We fix each sequence and collected at each our metrics. 

In the following is reported the distribution of the final number of roles obtained at different B values.
